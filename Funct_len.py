simbol = 'What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\
There are probably as many definitions for AI as there are areas within AI and the numbers keep growing. However, I am including a few below.\
AI refers to “robots, computers, and other machines with a humanlike ability to reason and solve problems” (McPherson, 2018, p. 4).\
Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\
Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today—from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars—rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing (https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html).\
AI or machine intelligence (MI) is intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.\
AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with human beings. It is technology with the ability to reason and solve problems.\
AI mainly focuses on understanding and performing intelligent tasks such as reasoning, learning new skills, and adopting to new situations and problems. It is a combination of computer science, psychology, and philosophy (Mogali, Artificial Intelligence and its applications in Libraries).\
AI refers to science and engineering that explores how to simulate various issues and functions in the field of human intelligence. AI technology fields cover perception, recognition, reasoning, the learning process, natural language, machine translation, games, chess, and so on.\
From Apple’s SIRI to self-driving cars, AI is progressing rapidly. While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s search algorithms to IBM’s Watson to autonomous weapons (Benefits & Risks of Artificial Intelligence. Future of Life Institute. Max Tegmark). AI is a major part of many cutting-edge technologies, including robotics, driverless cars, web searches, and video games. AI technologies use sophisticated algorithms, or sets of instructions, to solve very difficult tasks (Hulick, 2016, p. 12).\
Some AI technologies work behind the scenes to figure out who and what people like while they are using social media or shopping online (Hulick, 2016, p. 12).'
